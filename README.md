# D'accord - Interactive API Contracts

D'accord makes it easier to build disparate systems that will need to integrate
via RESTful web services. It allows you to decouple your integration work by
building your API server and client code against a common contract rather than
directly against each other.

D'accord is a suite of tools for making your APIs awesome:

1. API testing and interactive validation of your requests and responses sent
from your actual application code.
2. Generate API documentation from RAML specifications.
3. Provide mocking services for your API clients as well as your API servers.
